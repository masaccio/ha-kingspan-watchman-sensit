ðŸš€ Connections have been made more robust to catch timeouts when connecting to the Kingspan service for the first time.
ðŸš€ Low-level connection logging can be enabled to debug issues connecting to the Kingspan service (**WARNING: enabling this will log passwords in the Home Assistant Logfile**)

## v1.6.9

ðŸª² Fixes problem with `sensor.oil_consumption` reported in [issue-42](https://github.com/masaccio/ha-kingspan-watchman-sensit/issues/42) on version 2025.4 of Home Assistant Core.

ðŸª² Fixes load failure [issue-38](https://github.com/masaccio/ha-kingspan-watchman-sensit/issues/18) on version 2025.02 of Home Assistant Core.

## v1.6.7

ðŸš€ *BETA* test of new oil consumption data suitable for integration into the Home Assistant Energy Monitor. The data assumes a fixed energy density of fuel oil of 10.35 kWh per litre which cannot be configured. There is currently no variable pricing for oil, so this must be entered as a fixed cost per unit.

## v1.6.6

ðŸš€ Removes some warnings raised by Home Assistant for deprecated API calls and blocking I/O.

## v1.6.5

ðŸª² Fixes load failure [issue-18](https://github.com/masaccio/ha-kingspan-watchman-sensit/issues/18) on newer versions of Home Assistant Core.

## v1.6.3

Minor bug fixes:

ðŸª² Remove 'Unsupported state class' for tank capacity ([issue-17](https://github.com/masaccio/ha-kingspan-watchman-sensit/issues/17))
ðŸª² Threshold for a refill changed to +10% for calculating daily usage ([issue-15](https://github.com/masaccio/ha-kingspan-watchman-sensit/issues/15))
ðŸª² Allow setup of the integration before any readings have been sent to Kingspan's servers ([issue-14](https://github.com/masaccio/ha-kingspan-watchman-sensit/issues/14))

## v1.6.2

ðŸª² Fixes load failure [issue-10](https://github.com/masaccio/ha-kingspan-watchman-sensit/issues/10) on newer versions of Home Assistant Core. The minimum version is now 2023.10.0.

## v1.6.0

ðŸš€ Configuration option added for debugging Kingspan connections. When enabled, very verbose logs are generated for the connection to the Kingspan internet service. The logs include username and password.

## v1.5.0

ðŸš€ The integration now supports an options flow for configuring parameters. Currently supported parameters are the update interval (default is 8 hours) and the number of days to consider for average usage (default is 14 days). You can change these by clicking **Configure** from the integration's entry in **Settings > Devices & Services**.

## v1.4.5

ðŸª² Fixes timezone mismatch [issue-7](https://github.com/masaccio/ha-kingspan-watchman-sensit/issues/7). Previously the integration assumed that times were reported in UTC, which could result in **Last Reading Date** errors.
